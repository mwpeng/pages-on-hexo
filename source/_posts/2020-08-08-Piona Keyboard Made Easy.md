## Section 1

* persistence , be patient and practise daily
* sleep on it

### A bit of the history
* `Find middle C` because there were no black keys on keyboard
* `treble clef` is actually letter g
* `base clef` is actually letter f

### Learning the notes
* Local `D` note , that's less confusing comparing to `C`

### Oh no! not the black keys!
* Chromatic spacing: means the space between each not is `exactly the same` 
* Sharp means higher, and flat means lower.
* All the black keys actually have two names: one with sharp, one with flat.

## Section 2

### How to practise
* If any mistake, practise at a lower speed (for example, half speed)
* At least five minutes per day.
