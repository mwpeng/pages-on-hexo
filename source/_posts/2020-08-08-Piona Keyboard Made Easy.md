## Forward
[Understanding of music Seminars](https://understandingofmusic.com) By  Duncan Lorien

## Section 1

* persistence , be patient and practise daily
* sleep on it

### A bit of the history
* `Find middle C` because there were no black keys on keyboard
* `treble clef` is actually letter g
* `base clef` is actually letter f

### Learning the notes
* Local `D` note , that's less confusing comparing to `C`

### Oh no! not the black keys!
* Chromatic spacing: means the space between each not is `exactly the same` 
* Sharp means higher, and flat means lower.
* All the black keys actually have two names: one with sharp, one with flat.

## Section 2

### How to practise
* If any mistake, practise at a lower speed (for example, half speed)
* At least five minutes per day.

### Scales made easy.
* Scale : series of steps
* Key notes in a scale
    * ROOT: 1st note 
    * Subdominant: 4th note 
    * Dominant: 5th note 
* The space between the notes is known as an interval and is called a `semi-tone` or a `half-step`
* Pattern start with `0`
* The Major scale pattern: `2,2,1,2,2,2,1`
* The Minor scale pattern: `2,1,2,2,1,2,2`
* The Blue scale pattern: `3,2,1,1,3,2`
* Each Major scale has a related minor scale. (Use the same notes but start with different)
    * For example: C Major - A Minor
    * To find the related Minor of Major: count down three notes.
    
### Chords made easy.
* Pattern start with `0`
* pattern numbers are the spaces or intervals between the notes
* Major chords pattern: `4,3` 
* Most commonly played chords are C,F and G.
* Play base note using left hand.
* Play whole chard with one hand and the notes of the chord with the other hand. 
* Minor chords pattern: `3,4` 
* Only the middle note is different between Major and Minor chord. Move middle finger back one key.
* Each Major Chord has a related minor chord. 
    * To find the related Minor Chord of Major Chord: count down three 
    * For example: C Major Chord - A Minor Chord
* different ways of playing chord
    * together
    * one note at a time
    * tow notes then the other one.
* practise
    * move up and down to find all chords
    * major then minor
    * play with both hands (base key note)
